## Defect Workbench:

The defect workbench is used as part of daily planning meetings to determine what work needs to be performed on aircraft that day. Maintenance work is structured as follows:
  
  - Revisions (header level work items to be done - e.g. change a wheel)
    - Notifications (break down of individual items on a revision - e.g. jack up aircraft, undo bolts, etc)



## What you need to do:

An existing developer has moved team without completing their sprint tasks! They left a service called 'DefectService' and a stub method called 'defectWorkbenchByDate'. We need this method to be completed, according to the following rules:

- Find any Notifications that are due up to 7 days from today
- Create a Defect class for each one based on the Notification and add any necessary Revision data
- Return the list of Defects you built
- We've already added a dummy output - so when you run the code it will display any Defects you return



## After you're done

Like all good development teams, we'll be peer reviewing your work after you're done. We'll be asking a few questions around why you decided on your approach, how you might test it, what things you might change in the code you were left with, and so on
